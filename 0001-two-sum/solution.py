        Time Complexity: O(n), with O(1 + Î±) amortized HashTable operation
        Explanation: Each element has its leftover amount given the target
        like for example, given target 9, and element 2 will have leftover 7
        and element 7 will have leftover 2.
        
        When there is a pair of leftovers that are inside the array, we have an answer.
        We can store each {ele: leftover} and check to see if the leftover is in the HashTable
        to create this pair, for each element.
